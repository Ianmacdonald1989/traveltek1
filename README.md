## Brief

This project will create a web application that provides access to flight data and performs some basic analysis on the data. The application will consist of two parts:

An API that provides access to the flight data in JSON format.
A web page that retrieves data from the API and performs the analysis.
The flight data is in a file that contains information about different flights around the world over a two-week period. The important things to know about the data are:


* How many of the flights depart in the morning (before 12 AM)?
* What percentage of the total set of flights fly into Sweden?
* What are the 10 most popular destination airports?
* What's the average journey time between London Heathrow (LHR) and Dubai (DXB)?
* At least one other statistic that you find interesting

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

* The MVP for this project will be a web application that provides the following features:

A user interface for accessing the Flight Data API.
The ability to retrieve the following data points:
How many of the flights depart in the morning (before 12 AM)?

What are the 10 most popular destination airports?
What’s the average journey time between London Heathrow (LHR) and Dubai (DXB)?
At least one other statistic that you find interesting
The ability to export the data to a CSV file.
The MVP will be developed using React, MongoDB, and an API.

Benefits of the MVP
The MVP will provide the following benefits:

It will allow users to access the Flight Data API easily and conveniently.
